# Eppur Si ~~Muove~~ Illuminare

The light of dawn showing the way out of the woods, a lighthouse leading ships to safe harbor. Many cultures associate light with awareness, enlightenment, knowledge. The light of a candle was necessary for writing and reading, and, much like in writing, where the gaps between lines are crucial, the white voids, we could understand architecture as a game of space and light. Plečnik was well aware of this when he designed the library's stairway, which ascends towards the light just as the visitor ascends towards knowledge. His pillars/lights on the Tivoli promenade are likewise islands of light, showing the way between the trees – and it is these pillars that the Srdić Janežič team has chosen to redesign into lighthouses – mobile communicators. 

The lighting pillars have begun to move, no more mere static points, reliable coordinates in the dark. As they make their way along an unpredictable path, they are communicating among themselves with a language of light signals, broadcasting the distance between eachother. The author develops the fascination with mechanisms, motion and reactive objects that he previously already established with his projects Corporis animati (2015) and Horse power: the poetics of movement (2016). The mass and robustness of his installations serve as a counterpoint to the cyber culture of the non-material and the virtual, his objects-automata-animals are decidedly physical and corporeal. The focus is on the unpredictable behaviour of these mobile, animated bodies, rather than on their perfect and purpose-driven functioning that we have been taught to expect from machines.
